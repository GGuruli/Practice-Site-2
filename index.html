<p>I'm a twenty two year old senior student at <i><a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George Mason University</a></i>. I am completing a major in <strong>History</strong> while also working on a minor in <strong>Professional Writing</strong>.<br> I've always had an interest in researching the past and the different interpretations that arise from people studying it. I've developed an appreaciation for writing as well, and in doing so I have been trying to improve my writing in any way that I can. <a href="edu.html">This page here</a> can show what classes I think were most helpful for me. While I still have a lot to learn, my experiences have taught me much about the world and what I have to offer.</p>

<p>I also went to <a href="https://shortpumpms.henricoschools.us/"target="_blank">Short Pump Middle School</a> and <a href="https://deeprun.henricoschools.us/"target="_blank">Deep Run High School</a>. They gave me a decent education, though I don't know if I would say they prepared me properly for the future. </p>
